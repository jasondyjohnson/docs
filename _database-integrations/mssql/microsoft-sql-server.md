## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Connection issues and collation

If you're experiencing connection issues and have verified that the database user has the correct permissions, check your server's collation setting.

Connecting MSSQL to Stitch successfully requires that your server use **case-insensitive** collation.

### Data discrepancies and database user language settings

If you're missing data, check that the database user's language setting is set to `us_english`. Using a different setting can cause problems with replication, including issues with properly identifying new and updated data.
