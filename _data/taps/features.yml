#    INTEGRATION FEATURES    #
# -------------------------- #

## This file contains a list of the different features an integration might support.
## Different integration types (ex: database vs. SaaS) can support different things.

## The applies-to field will be "all-integrations" for features that apply to both database and SaaS integrations,
## Otherwise, it'll contain the type of integration that's applicable. Ex: "databases" for database integrations.

## Variable reference:

## display_name: The name of the feature as it should display in the docs
##
##         name: The feature ID, or key. This should match whatever the 
##               variable is in the integration docs. Ex: ssh is in the database integration docs
##               to indicate if SSH tunnels are supported.

##   applies-to: The integration type(s) the feature applies to. Can be:
##                  - "databases" - Applies to database integrations only
##                  - "saas" - Applies to SaaS integrations only
##                  - "webhooks" - Applies to webhook integrations only
##                  - "all-integrations" - Applies to SaaS AND database integrations 

##     doc-link: If applicable, the URL or /_data/urls.yml [link.[thing].[thing]] 
##               value of the documentation page for the feature. Note: If 
##               using urls.yml, the "prepend: site.baseurl" filter must be included.
