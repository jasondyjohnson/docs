Locate the database configuration file (usually `postgresql.conf`) and define the parameters as follows:

{{ config-file-lines }}

A few things to note:

- `max_standby_archive_delay` and `max_standby_streaming_delay` are only applicable if you're connecting a read replica to Stitch. If you aren't connecing a read replica, you don't have to define these parameters.
- For `max_replication_slots` and `max_wal_senders`, we're defaulting to a value of `5`. This should be sufficient **unless you have a large number of read replicas**.
