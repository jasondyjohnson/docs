**To use binlog replication, your {{ integration.display_name }} database must be running MySQL version 5.6.2 or greater**.

Additionally, setting up binlog replication requires rebooting your database to ensure parameter changes take effect. To minimize disruptions, we recommend performing the reboot during non-peak usage hours.

Next, you'll configure your server to use [Log-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}), or binlog replication.

Log-based Incremental Replication is a method of replication that reads a database's binary log files. These files contain information about modifications made to data in a {{ integration.display_name }} instance. Log-based Incremental Replication captures all inserts, updates, and deletes made to records during each replication job, and is the most accurate and efficient method of replication.

While Stitch recommends using Log-based Replication to replicate data, it isn't mandatory. Stitch offers additional [Replication Methods]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for {{ integration.display_name }} databases that don't require defining these settings.
